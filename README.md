# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:

To study the problem statement. SRS document and draw all the UML diagram of ATM system.

# SRS (Procedure):

1) In usecase diagram it consist of Actors usecases,Association.
2) In activity diagram it consists action initial, final, control flow.
3) Identify Actors and usecase for the system.
4) Desfine the classes and relationships for a specific task.
5) Model Interactions between objects for key process.
6) Identify objects and their relationship,this show the flow of messages between them for a specific process.
